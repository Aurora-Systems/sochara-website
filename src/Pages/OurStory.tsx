                <p className="">
                 A 21st century clothing brand, on the rise to becoming the lifeline of the clothing industry for present and future generations of young people. With it’s unique designs and use of rare fabrics, it’s core purpose is to increase inter-tier clothing, that is, the representation of various clothing tiers i.e fitness and corporate clothing, in one particular piece.
The brand was established in 2021 and has it’s principal headquarters in Harare, Zimbabwe and is steadily on the rise to becoming an internationally recognized trademark.
SOCHARA was founded by the young, Miss Stacey Majuru at the tender age of 19, with desires to nurture her talents and those of other like minded young people and build a household name that has clothing unique to the brand. As such, every individual associated with the brand is no older than 24, as the brand is described as being “for young people, by young people”.
“set•yourself•apart” became the brand's slogan and Miss Stacey explained that she chose these particular words to live by because “In this era, everyone is doing everything. They'll tell you to venture into a less populated industry, but there really isn’t one. It’s all about picking your poison, picking an industry that fulfils your passion, and then setting yourself apart from the rest in that same line of work, being different and giving people a reason to choose you”.
